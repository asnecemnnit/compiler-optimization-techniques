## Introduction

Compiler optimizations play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of C++ code. This repository aims to offer a hands-on learning experience with exercises covering a range of optimization techniques.

## Optimization Techniques

The exercises cover the following optimization techniques:

- [Loop Unrolling](src/loop_unrolling.cpp)
- [Inlining](src/inlining.cpp)
- [Vectorization](src/vectorization.cpp)
- [Loop Tiling](src/loop_tiling.cpp)
- [Caching](src/caching.cpp)
- [Loop Fusion](src/loop_fusion.cpp)


## Getting Started

To begin working on the exercises, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/compiler-optimization-techniques.git

2. Choose an optimization technique from the src directory.

3. Unoptimized and optimized functions can be tested by building and running the corresponding cpp file.

4. Optionally, assembly (asm) files can be generated for each optimization technique, and the unoptimized and optimized assembly functions can be compared.
