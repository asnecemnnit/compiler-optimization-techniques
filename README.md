## Introduction

Compiler optimizations play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of C++ code. This repository aims to offer a hands-on learning experience with exercises covering a range of optimization techniques. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, these exercises will help you sharpen your skills in writing optimized C++ code.

## Optimization Techniques

The exercises cover the following optimization techniques:

- [Loop Unrolling](exercises/LoopUnrolling/)
- [Inlining](exercises/Inlining/)
- [Vectorization](exercises/Vectorization/)
- [Loop Tiling](exercises/LoopTiling/)
- [Caching](exercises/Caching/)

Each technique has its own set of exercises with provided initial code (`main.cpp`), a solution (`solution.cpp`), and test cases (`test/`). Explore the directories within the `exercises/` folder to get started.

## Getting Started

To begin working on the exercises, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/compiler-optimization-techniques.git
2. Choose an optimization technique from the exercises/ directory.

3. Open the exercise folder, read the instructions in main.cpp, and start optimizing the code.

4. Test your solution against the provided test cases in the test/ directory.

5. Check the solution.cpp file for a reference optimized solution.
